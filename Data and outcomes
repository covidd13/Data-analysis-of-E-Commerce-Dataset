Those who don't know what is RFM
RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value. It is commonly used in database marketing and direct marketing.
RFM stands for:

Recency: How recently did the customer purchase?

Frequency: How often do they purchase?

Monetary Value: How much do they spend?

Customer purchases may be represented by a table with columns for the customer name, date of purchase and purchase value. 
One approach to RFM is to assign a score for each dimension on a scale from 1 to 10. 
The maximum score represents the preferred behavior and a formula could be used to calculate the three scores for each customer. 
For example, a service-based business could use these calculations:

Recency: the maximum of "10 â€“ the number of months that have passed since the customer last purchased" and 1

Frequency: the maximum of "the number of purchases by the customer in the last 12 months (with a limit of 10)" and 1

Monetary: the highest value of all purchases by the customer expressed as a multiple of some benchmark value

On the basis of these values customers are then divided into specific grpoups.
